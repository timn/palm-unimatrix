==============================================================================


=== v0.9

* Sun Mar 16 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Added PHP include for sponsoring in index.php

* Thu Mar 13 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>

- Fixed Cache, cann now call CacheRegister within anothers Cache's LoadFunc
- Added Caching for short names

* Sun Mar 09 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Lots of changes :-)
- Removed MainFormInit(), was useless anyway
- Added caching functionality to speed up drawing of short names and short
  types (when enabled in preferences screen)
  I really like that feature since it is my first useful implementation of
  binary search :-)
  You can see this feature used in clist.c in CourseGetName
- DATABASE_VERSION changed to three. Need to do a sort for version 2.
- Removed DatabaseGetNewCID, this functionality is now implemented as
  CourseNewID in clist.c.
- 


* Sun Mar 02 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Restructered prefs code, now we have one preferences struct
- removed feature stuff from gadget.c. Not needed any more with the new
  prefs struct. Could even get rid of DatabaseGetCat and GadgetSetNumdays.
  Maybe later
- Rewrote stroke code. No we have stroke from upper right to lower right and
  lower right to upper right. Feels better.
- Added code to show short names for courses in main form in event boxes

* Thu Feb 13 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Added italian translation. Thanx to Carlo Seenam Cavaliere
- Added typo fix for english translation

* Thu Feb 06 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Added CVS Ids in the source, imported to internal CVS
- First support for gadget keystrokes.
- Cleaned up clist.c and added CourseGetIndex
  IMPORTANT CHANGES:
- Added multigen support to make it possible to grow the code
  Therefore added UniMatrix.def, changed Makefile to include support for
  multigen and moved several functions to SECOND_SECTION code segment
  (namely exam, pref and clist functions)
- Moved all resource IDs to resources.h to get rid of those dumb problems with
  Pilrc because it does not like #define with NaN argument... (Makros,
  section stuff etc.).
  This made a change for ALL resources needed.

=== v0.8a

* Thu Jan 30 2003 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Finally release, no further changes

* Mon Dec 11 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Updated french translation
- Updated czech translation
- Updated polish translation

* Tue Dec 10 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Happy Birthday Hendrik!

* Mon Dec 02 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Added fixes for french translation
- Added FAQ entry for PalmOS <3.5


=== v0.8

* Tue Nov 29 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Happy birthday Medha!
- Fixed bug that timeline was erased under some cirumstances
- Added support for the vchrSendData keyDown even

* Tue Nov 19 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Current Weekday is now highlighted
- Weekdays are redrawn by GadgetDrawTimeline
- Now handling sysAppLaunchCmdAskUser. We always say "OK" since we have our
  own code in place to handle that. Looks nicer and reduces TNOT (Total Number
  Of Taps).

* Fr Nov 15 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- UniMatrix got an article in the german magazine "Notebook, Organizer und
  Handy". Yeah! It already appeared in the September issue 10/02, but the
  didn't tell me. An old friend pointed that out. Thanx Tine!

* Thu Nov 13 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Timeline features is now working
- Sent new strings to translators

* Tue Nov 12 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Fixed bug, while demonstrating the new beam code to Medha we discovered a
  new bug: When beaming a semester all courses got new Course ID of 0. The bug
  was in DatabaseGetNewCID(..). It always used gCategory to get the current
  category. But that is wrong in case of beam. We need to give it the cat
  of the newly created category. Doh! Parameters changed and now it works.
- Removed some functions to make the code cleaner, namely GadgetDrawComplete*
  had to go, GadgetRedraw() will do the job. GadgetSetNeedsRedraw has been
  removed. This is now set when a complete redraw is done in GadgetRedraw.
- Added gGadgetFeature array to make feature handling (like showing short
  type names or the timeline) easy
- Fixed GadgetEventIsVisible so that it will not return true in border cases
  (e. g. if you have a course ending at 20:00 it is no longer highlightet in
  night screen. Makes no sense...)
- Added Timeline feature. Shows a XOR drawn line for current time
- Color picker is now palette for gray scale users by default and sliders for
  color palm users

* Mon Nov 11 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Begin of German Carneval in Cologne. Helau.
- Fixed bug in color initialisation code which caused UniMatrix to fail on
  Palms with a display that does not support gray scale display (like the
  antique Palm III)
- Moved TNGlueInit to TNGlueColorInit, this reflects the real purpose.
- Moved last fragments of color initialisation code from UniMatrix.c to
  tnglue.c/TNGlueColorInit()
- Changed default behaviour for TNGlue. It will now use PalmOS 3.5 code as
  default as that should always work. We use the 4.0 code only if the coder
  calls TNGlueColorInit on a 4.0 device and use the new functions. As I don't
  know the implementation details I can just assume they found a quicker way
  than the 3.5 code...
- Fixed bug in edit.c which caused that wrong data was displayed in the hint
  after creating a new course. Data is NOT corrupted, just displayed wrong.
  Now it does highlight the new event after adding it.

* Thu Nov 06 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Beam code was not yet completely intelligent... It always took the first
  course with a matching name and didn't care about the course type... FIXED.
- It is now possible to beam whole semesters. Finally...
- Fixed small bug in new semester transmission code. It always took the last
  available free ID, but we want the first one, otherwise we would get
  BadErrors(TM) when the user was so dumb to delete his first category...
  That is still NotNice(C). Should think about some code to prevent the case
  that no category exists. That sucks. Should generate some default then, I
  think... Tommorrow :-)

* Tue Nov 05 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Fixed non-initialized index in CourseTypeDelete
- Added support for showing short type in gadget boxes for events if height
  is greater than 10 and the if the feature is enabled in the settings dialog
- Added czech translation
- Fixed bug in beam.c/ReadRecordIntoDB. It used DatabaseSort and that will
  crash UniMatrix when receiving an entry while UniMatrix is _not_ running.
  Wrote DatabaseSortByDBRef for that purpose which will take an open
  database handle as argument and will sort this db, not the globally opened
  ones.
- Changed spacing in exams table, cosmetic fix
- MAJOR: Fixed beaming code and made it intelligent. It now detects if
  the received course already exists (checks name) or if there are already
  matching times or exams.


* Sat Nov 01 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- 4 1/2 years with Anne!
- *grmpf*. Used Palm OS 4 Update 1 before, with with BuildDefaults.h from
  non-updated version... This still allows access to struct internals, update
  1 does not. That made me searching for "dereferencing pointer to
  incomplete type" bugs for an hour now. That's a stupid one. I have used
  this internal access only once: it's from the example code for extended
  Gadgets from Palm themselves. That's dumb!
  So I fixed gadget.c GadgetTap now to use standard functions...
- moved color.(c|h) to tnglue.(c|h). This reflects adding
  TNGetObjectIndexFromPtr to the file... It is more glue, than color now...
- Added TNGlueInit() to tnglue. Will now set color mode, no further
  interaction from outside needed for initialisation.

* Fri Oct 25 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Added handling for power on events. If you switch the Palm to on while
  UniMatrix is running it will now jump to the next upcoming event



=== v0.7

* Thu Oct 24 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Polish translation and dutch translation, fixed both, make extra note that
  course type short names may be only 3 chars in length

* Thu Oct 17 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Of course I forgot to maintain this file...
- Added exam management, strike out done exams :-)
- Better support for hard buttons, if you assigned a button to the tool you
  you now get to the next entry by clicking this button
- Lots of internal cleanus
- Merged add and edit screens for courses and events, saves about 3 KB
- Fixed course type details screen, strings were missing, added graphical
  buttons
- course list now shows emails and website form currently selected course
- wrote dist section in makefile, not I can create the release really easy
  for all languages.


* Thu Aug 16 2002 Tim Niemueller <tim@niemueller.de>
- Finally created the CHANGES file. 0.6 is out to the public and seems that
  people really like UniMatrix, a good reason to fix all those glitches and
  make it nice to use...
- Did a lot of work on the "build system". This means that resources are now
  in /resources with an ending of ".rcp.in". I changed the makefile so that
  those files are piped through sed to replace all occurrences of ##VERSION##
  in the rcp with the current version. This is now stored in a file called
  "version", this makes it easier since I now have to maintain only one place
  for the version number
- Add some new variables to the Makefile, namely PROGNAME, PROGDES and APPID
  that should make it much easier to re-use the makefile for other software.
- Created docs subdirectory
- OK, now some real coding stuff:
